**🚗Autonomous Driving in CARLA 0.9.13**

This project presents a complete autonomous-driving simulation built in CARLA 0.9.13, designed specifically for Town03. The system places an ego vehicle in a realistic urban environment where it navigates 
from a random starting point to a distant destination using CARLA’s BasicAgent. The route is generated through the GlobalRoutePlanner, ensuring the navigation follows proper road topology and lane structure. The ego vehicle strictly adheres to its lane and adjusts its speed intelligently, slowing down when approaching sharp curves and regaining speed on straight segments to maintain smooth and realistic driving behavior.

To simulate real-world challenges, this project introduces virtual potholes placed intelligently along the ego vehicle’s route. These potholes are detected well in advance by the ego vehicle, which determines a safe side—left or right—for avoidance based on the road layout. During avoidance, the car temporarily overrides the agent’s natural steering to make a controlled sidestep, reduces throttle for safety, and returns to its lane once the obstacle has been cleared. The avoidance behavior is stable, smooth, and free from oscillation or looping, making it suitable even for mid-range hardware setups.

In addition to obstacles, the simulation includes pedestrian movement to introduce dynamic and unpredictable elements. Multiple walkers are spawned across the map using the navigation mesh. Their movement is randomized, and additional walkers are instructed to cross in front of the ego vehicle at random times. When a pedestrian is detected in front of it and within a danger zone, the ego vehicle automatically applies the brakes and waits until it is safe to proceed. The system ensures proper reaction to pedestrians while maintaining smooth resumption of motion afterward.

The environment also includes traffic vehicles that drive autonomously using CARLA’s autopilot system. These vehicles add realism and complexity to the scenario, forcing the ego vehicle to navigate through a living, moving environment. The combination of traffic, pedestrians, potholes, and realistic route planning allows the simulation to closely mimic real driving challenges.

Visualization plays a key role in this project. A third-person chase camera covers the entire Pygame window, giving a cinematic view of the ego vehicle’s movement. A compact front-facing camera feed is displayed in the bottom-right corner, helping visualize how the road and obstacles appear from the vehicle’s perspective. A custom minimap is rendered in the top-left corner, drawing the entire Town03 road network, the calculated route, the ego vehicle’s location, pothole positions, and the final destination. This minimap updates in real time and serves as a simple yet effective navigation overview.

The project uses Python 3.7.9, CARLA’s built-in Python API, pygame for visualization, and numpy for image conversion and geometric calculations. No external machine learning models are required, making the entire system lightweight and efficient. Despite its simplicity, the project demonstrates concepts that are fundamental to real autonomous driving, such as path planning, obstacle avoidance, perception, and behavioural decision-making.

Overall, this project serves as a complete and visually rich demonstration of autonomous vehicle behaviour inside CARLA 0.9.13. It integrates pothole avoidance, pedestrian safety, traffic interaction, route following, and multi-camera visualization into a single cohesive system. It is ideal for students, researchers, and hobbyists looking to explore or showcase core principles of autonomous navigation without requiring heavy computational resources or complex neural networks.
